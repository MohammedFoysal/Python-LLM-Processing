10. Benefits
Acme Org offers a comprehensive benefits package that may include health, dental, and vision insurance, a retirement savings plan with company matching, paid time off (PTO) including annual leave, sick leave, and bank holidays, parental leave, professional development opportunities and training reimbursement, and employee assistance programmes (EAP).

Eligibility for benefits is based on employment status. Full-time employees are eligible for all benefits after a three-month probationary period. Part-time employees are eligible for pro-rated benefits based on their contracted hours. Contractors and temporary staff are not typically eligible for benefits unless otherwise specified in their employment contract. Details regarding eligibility, enrolment, and any updates to benefits are provided during onboarding and through regular HR communications.

11. Remote Work Policy
Acme Org supports flexible work arrangements and permits remote work depending on the job role and managerial approval. Employees working remotely must maintain regular working hours and be available during core business hours. Communication must be conducted using company-approved platforms such as Microsoft Teams and Outlook. Remote employees are expected to meet the same performance and confidentiality standards as on-site staff. A safe and productive home work environment is required, including a stable internet connection, secure computer equipment provided or approved by the company, and adherence to cybersecurity protocols. Remote work arrangements are reviewed regularly and may be modified or revoked based on business needs or performance.

12. Promotion Process
Promotions at Acme Org are guided by merit, performance, and organisational need. The process includes regular performance reviews, the submission of a personal development plan outlining achievements and goals, managerial and departmental assessments, and the evaluation of qualifications, leadership potential, and cultural contribution. Available positions are advertised internally to support employee growth and development. Employees are encouraged to communicate their career aspirations with their managers and participate in training and development initiatives.

13. Types of Employment Contracts
Acme Org utilises several types of employment contracts to accommodate various operational requirements. Permanent contracts apply to full-time and part-time employees with no fixed end date, offering full benefits and long-term job security, subject to performance and organisational changes. Fixed-term contracts are used for roles of limited duration, such as project assignments or temporary cover, with benefits clearly defined in the contract. Casual contracts involve work on an as-needed basis, usually with variable hours and without guaranteed benefits. Freelancer and consultancy agreements are established for independent professionals delivering specialised services, with clearly defined terms of engagement. All contract terms are detailed in the employment agreement and discussed thoroughly during onboarding. Questions regarding contract types should be directed to the HR department.

14. Procurement Policy for Third-Party Vendors and Suppliers
Acme Org maintains a structured procurement policy to ensure transparency, fairness, and value in all engagements with third-party vendors and suppliers. Procurement decisions are made based on quality, cost-effectiveness, reliability, and alignment with company standards. All vendors must comply with Acme Org's ethical standards and legal requirements. Suppliers are evaluated and selected through a formal process which may include requests for proposals (RFPs), competitive bidding, and due diligence checks. Contracts with vendors are reviewed by the legal and finance teams to ensure compliance and risk mitigation. Ongoing performance is monitored, and contracts may be re-evaluated periodically to ensure they continue to meet the organisation’s operational and strategic needs.

Sustainability and environmental impact are key factors in supplier selection. Acme Org prioritises partnerships with vendors who demonstrate sustainable practices, such as reducing carbon emissions, responsible sourcing of materials, waste reduction initiatives, and compliance with environmental regulations. Suppliers must be willing to provide evidence of their sustainability commitments.

The company maintains a preferred supplier list based on past performance, reliability, and alignment with our values. While new suppliers are welcome to apply and be considered, preference will be given to those already vetted and proven. This approach helps streamline procurement processes, reduce risk, and maintain high-quality standards.

To ensure continued compliance and ethical conduct, Acme Org conducts regular supplier audits. These audits are carried out annually for all high-risk and strategic suppliers, and biennially for other approved vendors. The audits may include reviewing documentation, site visits, interviews, and assessments of working conditions and environmental practices. Suppliers must cooperate fully during audits and address any identified deficiencies in a timely manner. A written report is produced following each audit, detailing findings, commendations, and required corrective actions.

Any significant non-compliance identified during an audit must be rectified within a specified timeframe determined by Acme Org. If corrective actions are not implemented, the matter is escalated to the procurement governance committee for further action, which may include probationary status, contract renegotiation, or termination.

Ethical sourcing guidelines are an integral part of the procurement framework. All suppliers are expected to uphold fundamental human rights, provide fair working conditions, adhere to legal labour standards, and avoid practices such as child labour, forced labour, and unsafe working environments. Acme Org reserves the right to terminate agreements with suppliers found to be in violation of these ethical standards.

Compliance training is mandatory for all procurement and contract management staff. This training ensures a thorough understanding of supplier assessment procedures, ethical sourcing principles, and audit processes. Refresher training is conducted annually, with specialised sessions following any regulatory updates or significant procedural changes.

All procurement activities are incorporated into the organisation’s broader risk management framework. Supplier-related risks, including financial, operational, and reputational risks, are documented, monitored, and reviewed regularly as part of the corporate risk register. Risk mitigation strategies are developed collaboratively between the procurement, compliance, and legal departments, and reviewed by the executive risk committee on a quarterly basis.

15. Termination of Employment
Employment may be terminated voluntarily or involuntarily. Employees are encouraged to provide two weeks' notice if resigning. The company may terminate employment in cases of misconduct, performance issues, or business needs.

16. Acknowledgement
All employees are required to sign an acknowledgement form confirming they have read and understood this policy manual.
